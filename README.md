To do,

- comment index.ts fully and the modules to explain what happens
- research into:
    - Why VSCode auto adds some imports, figure that out in the settings
    - Understand more of .argv
    - ...${}
    - ...template literals
    - ...relearn arrow functions
    - ...difference between for and foreach
    - ...datatypes
    - ...objects
    - ...typeof
    - ...prototype
    - ...entries
    - ...import
    - ...readfile (specific utf-8)
    - ...regex


indextraining.ts was used specifically for building my project from step to step. 

index.ts is where the project lives.
